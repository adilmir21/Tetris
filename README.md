The Pieces (tetraamines) are generated randomly. The pieces start from the top and move towards bottom of the board and stop at the bottom or when they collide with another piece. When pieces are stacked together and collide with the top of the board, the game ends. To play the game following keys are used.
•	Right arrow key to move towards Right
•	Left arrow key to move towards Left
•	Down arrow key to move downward fast
•	‘a’ to rotate the piece
•	‘b’ to shift the piece to its original shape.
